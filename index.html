        My name is Max, and I’m currently studying Computer Science at York University. I’ve always had a deep appreciation for all forms of art, from music and visual arts to storytelling. At the same time, I’m passionate about sports and fitness—especially weightlifting. A unique fact about me is that I benched 315 pounds at just 17 years old, which is something I take a lot of pride in. I was born and raised in Toronto, a city that has shaped me in many ways. Growing up here meant being exposed to different cultures, ideas, and experiences that pushed me to be open-minded and ambitious. Toronto’s fast-paced environment and competitive nature made me strive for excellence, whether in academics, fitness, or my personal interests. The mix of urban energy and diverse perspectives helped me become adaptable, creative, and motivated to challenge myself in different fields. I enrolled in the Lassonde Engineering program because I wanted to develop my ability to create innovative solutions, whether through coding, design, or technology. My strengths in logical thinking, creativity, and discipline from years of weightlifting have helped me excel in my studies.

     As a software engineer co-op at PointClickCare, my primary goal is to further develop my technical expertise in building robust, scalable, and secure healthcare technology solutions. I am passionate about using my software engineering skills to improve healthcare systems and patient care. I aim to continuously learn and contribute to developing innovative solutions that have a tangible impact on the healthcare sector.

                Technical and Professional Development Goals
                Master advanced front-end development techniques using React and JavaScript to create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces that enhance the user experience for healthcare professionals.
                
                Improve cloud-based infrastructure knowledge to build more scalable solutions for healthcare applications, ensuring better performance and lower downtime.
                
                Enhance security practices in healthcare software development, ensuring compliance with regulations like HIPAA while protecting sensitive patient data.
                
                Professional Experience at PointClickCare
                At PointClickCare, I’ve had the opportunity to work on several key projects aimed at improving the healthcare experience for both providers and patients. My contributions focus on enhancing system performance, user interface design, and security within PointClickCare’s suite of applications.
                
                Course Project
                Although many fitness apps are available, we, along with many others, feel that none truly cater to our unique health goals in a personalized and effective way. That's why we decided to create an app that acts like a personal fitness trainer, designed to tailor a program specifically for each user.
                
                Our app not only creates personalized workout plans based on the user's goals but also adapts and evolves with the user’s progress. By leveraging AI-driven recommendations and advanced progress tracking, we ensure that each program is as dynamic and flexible as a real trainer would be. Additionally, our app fosters a sense of community, offering support and motivation through shared goals and challenges.
                
                With this, we aim to help users reach their desired physical goal while providing a personalized, ever-evolving experience that supports them throughout their fitness journey.
